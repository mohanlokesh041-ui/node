1?? Difference Between Node.js and Express.js
? What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment.
It allows JavaScript to run outside the browser (on the server).
?? Example:
console.log("Hello from server");
Before Node ? JS only worked inside browser
After Node ? JS works in backend/server

? What is Express.js?
Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js.
It helps us create:
* APIs
* Routes
* Middleware
* Server easily

?? Difference
Node.jsExpress.jsRuntime environmentFrameworkRuns JS on serverMakes server development easierLow-levelHigh-level
?? Why We Use Express Instead of Only Node?
Without Express:
const http = require("http");
Everything manual.
With Express:
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
Much easier, cleaner, faster development.

2?? What is .env ?
? What is it?
.env is a file used to store:
* Secret keys
* Port number
* Database URL
* JWT secret
* API keys

?? Why we use it?
Security ??
Instead of:
const password = "mysecret123";
We use:
DB_PASSWORD=mysecret123
Then in code:
require("dotenv").config();
process.env.DB_PASSWORD

?? Developer Purpose
* Keeps sensitive data safe
* Different values for dev & production
* Easy configuration management

3?? What is listen() ?
? What is it?
app.listen() starts the server.
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running");
});

?? Why we use it?
Without listen():
Server won’t start.
It tells Node:
?? “Start listening to requests on this port”

4?? What is Express?
? Definition:
Express is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js
It handles:
* Routing
* Middleware
* HTTP requests
* APIs
Official website: https://expressjs.com

5?? Why We Use Express?
Because it:
* Simplifies server creation
* Makes REST API easy
* Supports middleware
* Fast & lightweight
* Huge community support
Example:
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("All users");
});
Very simple ??

6?? What is Nodemon?
? What is it?
nodemon automatically restarts server when you change file.
Without nodemon:
Every time:
CTRL + C
node index.js
With nodemon:
nodemon index.js
It auto restarts ??

?? Why we use it?
For developer productivity.
It saves time during development.
Install:
npm install -g nodemon

7?? What is Port Number and Localhost?
? What is Port?
A port is like a door number for your server.
Example:
http://localhost:5000
5000 ? port number

? What is localhost?
localhost means:
?? Your own computer
IP address:
127.0.0.1
So:
http://localhost:5000
Means:
?? My computer server running on port 5000

8?? What is API?
? Full Form:
Application Programming Interface
Simple meaning:
API = A bridge between frontend and backend

Example Flow:
Frontend:
fetch("/users")
Backend:
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});
API connects both.

?? Why we use API?
* Send data
* Receive data
* Login
* Register
* Fetch products
* Payment
All done using APIs.

9?? Flow of Express + Frontend Process
Let’s understand full real developer flow ??
Step 1:
User clicks button in React
Step 2:
React sends request
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/login")
Step 3:
Express receives request
app.post("/api/login")
Step 4:
Backend checks DB
Step 5:
Backend sends response
res.json({ success: true });
Step 6:
Frontend receives response

Full Flow Diagram:
User ? Frontend ? API Request ? Express ? Database ? Response ? Frontend ? User

?? What is package.json?
? What is it?
package.json is the heart of your Node project.
It contains:
* Project name
* Version
* Dependencies
* Scripts
* Author

Example:
{
  "name": "backend-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
}

?? Why we use it?
* Manage packages
* Install dependencies
* Run scripts
* Share project with team
When someone runs:
npm install
It installs all dependencies from package.json.
